# - a field in "quotes" just returns the bit inside the quotes instead of the actual field
#   ("Feed Name" or "@everyone"?)
# - a field in *asterisks* or _underscores_ gets italicized
# - a field in **double-asterisks** gets bolded
# - ***triple*** gets you bold italics
# - A field in `backquotes` gets marked up as code
# - For a code block, wrap in ```
# - a field with no markup here will have the HTML in it replaced with markdown (discord's format language)
# If you want a field that contains HTML to have a chance of not being horrifyingly ugly, do the plain option.
